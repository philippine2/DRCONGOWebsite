<h1>Natural Resources</h1>
<p> The natural resources of the Congo are some of its most important resources.
    The Republic Congo is an African nation that covers an area of roughly 132,000 square miles, making it the 64th largest
    country globally.

        <h3>Forests</h3>
        <p>
            In 2015, roughly 65.4% of Congo's land was covered with forests according to estimates from the World Bank. Since 2005,
            the amount of forest cover in Congo has been declining due to continuous deforestation. Rainforests make up the most
            substantial part of forests in the Congo as they cover roughly 60% of the nation's entire area. Forests in the Congo are
            mainly used for the production of timber which is one of the country's major exports. Most of the timber exports from
            the Congo, roughly 90% according to some estimates, are made up of raw logs. Approximately 90% of the wood products sold
            from Congo are sold to China.

        <h3>Minerals</h3>
        <p>
            The Republic of the Congo has been blessed with a wide variety of mineral resources that are vital to the country's
            economy such as diamonds, copper, and gold. The Congolese government set up the Department of Mines and Geology to
            manage the country's mineral resources. Congo's mineral resources are yet to be adequately exploited; however, the vast
            quantities of minerals in the country have attracted large numbers of international companies.
            By 2012, the Congolese government had only issued seven licenses to allow companies to extract minerals from the
            country.

        <h3>Livestock</h3>
        <p>
            Farmers in the Republic of the Congo keep a large variety of livestock such as pigs, cattle, and goats. The Congolese
            government implemented policies to improve the country's livestock sector. The primary reform that the Congolese
            government instituted in the livestock industry was the introduction of the lease system. Through the lease system, the
            government loaned Congolese farmers several animals and expected the same number of animals in return in a couple of
            years.
            Through the lease system, the number of animals in the Congo has increased significantly.
